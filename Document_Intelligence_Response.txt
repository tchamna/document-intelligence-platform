DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE EXPERIENCE - PORTFOLIO SUMMARY

Candidate: [Your Name]
Date: December 9, 2025
Position: Data Scientist - AI & Document Intelligence

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

I have hands-on experience building a complete Document Intelligence Platform that demonstrates production-ready capabilities across all key focus areas outlined in the role. My portfolio project showcases end-to-end intelligent document processing, from document classification to automated claims adjudication, deployed with CI/CD to a production environment.

================================================================================
ALIGNMENT WITH KEY FOCUS AREAS
================================================================================

1. DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE
-------------------------

What I Built:
• Document Classification Model - ML-powered classifier that categorizes healthcare documents into types: disability claims, enrollment forms, policy certificates, and RFPs
• Entity Extraction Pipeline - NLP-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy to extract:
    - Patient/claimant information (names, SSN, DOB)
    - Policy numbers and claim IDs
    - Dates (disability onset, effective dates, enrollment dates)
    - Monetary amounts (benefit amounts, premiums)
    - Provider information (physicians, employers)
    - Diagnosis codes and medical conditions
• Data Normalization - Standardized extraction output across varying document formats

Technologies Used: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn, FastAPI


2. CLAIMS & POLICY AUTOMATION
------------------------------

What I Built:
• Rule-Based Adjudication Engine - Automated claims decisioning system that:
    - Validates policy coverage and eligibility
    - Checks elimination periods and benefit periods
    - Applies policy exclusions (pre-existing conditions, self-inflicted injuries)
    - Generates automated decisions: APPROVED, DENIED, PENDING, DOCS_MISSING
• Decision Reasoning - Each adjudication includes detailed reasoning for audit trails
• Batch Processing - High-throughput processing of multiple documents simultaneously

Sample Decision Output:
{
  "decision": "APPROVED",
  "confidence": 0.94,
  "reasoning": [
    "Policy POL-789-4567 is active",
    "90-day elimination period satisfied",
    "Diagnosis 'carpal tunnel syndrome' is covered",
    "No exclusions apply"
  ]
}


3. POLICY & ENROLLMENT PARSING
-------------------------------

What I Built:
• Policy Interpreter Module - Parses complex policy documents to extract:
    - Coverage terms and conditions
    - Elimination periods
    - Benefit periods and amounts
    - Exclusion clauses
    - Own-occupation definitions
• Eligibility Engine - Matches enrollment data against policy rules:
    - Employment status verification
    - Dependent eligibility checking
    - Coverage level determination (Employee, Employee+Spouse, Family)
    - Effective date validation


4. HIGH-PRECISION MODELING
---------------------------

My Approach to 97-99% Precision:
• Confidence Scoring - All extractions include confidence scores for quality control
• Validation Rules - Business logic validation on extracted entities
• Human-in-the-Loop - Low-confidence results flagged for review
• Continuous Improvement - Architecture supports model retraining with feedback

Current Metrics (Demo Environment):
• Document Classification: 95%+
• Entity Extraction: 92%+
• Claims Adjudication: 94%+
